  <title>Plans</title>
  <para>
   &suse;&mdash;together with the cloud service providers&mdash;offers
   different plans to cater to a variety of use cases. While details differ
   depending on the cloud framework, usually there are two types of
   subscriptions.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Pay as you go (PAYG)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>Pay as you go</literal> (PAYG) are used to create on-demand
      instances. When an instance is first booted, it automatically registers
      with a local update server. Once the system finishes booting, it is ready
      to use.
     </para>
     <para>
      This makes PAYG instances great for bursting production workloads and for
      testing. Create an instance when you need it and delete it when you are
      done. You only pay for the resources you use. Upcharges over the basic
      cloud prices may apply, depending on the framework.
     </para>
     <para>
      PAYG instances include support through the cloud provider which in turn is
      supported by &suse;. &azure; also offers a basic PAYG image that only
      includes updates. Instances created from this image are not eligible for
      support.
    </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Bring your own subscription (BYOS)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>Bring your own subscription</literal> (BYOS) images are useful if
      you already have a support contract with &suse; and want to move your
      workloads to the public cloud. An instance launched from a BYOS image is
      equivalent to a physical machine that just received a &sles; installation
      from the &slsa; installation image. After creation, use 
      <command>registercloudguest</command> to register the instance with the
      &scc;, or connect it to your running &rmt; or &suma; infrastructure using
      the entitlements you already have along with any update infrastructure you
      may already manage.
     </para>
     <para>
      BYOS instances make it easier to manage extensions such as LTSS or kernel
      live-patching. Extensions for PAYG instances can only be used in
      conjunction with &suma;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>
   In summary, if you already have a direct relationship with &suse; you
   generally want to start out with BYOS. You can still use PAYG for on-demand
   excess capacity.

   <title>Switching plans is not possible</title>
   <para>
    Switching from PAYG to BYOS or vice-versa is only possible on &azure;
    through the <literal>Hybrid Benefit</literal> program. For all other cloud
    providers, you remain on the plan you initially selected for as long as the
    instance is running. The only way to switch plans is to start with the
    other image and rebuild your system.

   change a SUSE instance (once written). -->

   <title>Do not register PAYG instances with the &scc;</title>
   <para>
    Registering PAYG instances with the &scc; or your own &rmt; server will
    create conflicts that are not easily solved. Only register BYOS instances.
    PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update
    server.
