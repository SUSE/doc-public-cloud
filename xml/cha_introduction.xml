 <sect1 xml:id="sec-intro-plans">
  <title>Plans</title>
  <para>
   &suse;&mdash;together with the cloud service providers&mdash;offers
   different plans to cater to a variety of use cases. While details differ
   depending on the cloud framework, usually there are two types of
   subscriptions.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Bring your own subscription (BYOS)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>Bring your own subscription</literal> (BYOS) images are useful if
      you already have a support contract with &suse; and want to move your
      workloads to the public cloud. An instance launched from a BYOS image is
      equivalent to a physical machine that just received a &sles; installation
      from the &slsa; installation image. After creation, use 
      <command>registercloudguest</command> to register the instance with the
      &suse;-operated update infrastructure in the cloud framework or use the
      <command>&suseconnect;</command> to register the system with &scc; using
      the entitlements you already have. Connect your system to your own
      running &rmt; or &suma; infrastructure in the same way you connect
      systems in your data center.
     </para>
     <para>
      BYOS instances make it easier to manage extensions such as LTSS or kernel
      live-patching. Extensions for PAYG instances can only be used in
      conjunction with &suma;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Pay as you go (PAYG)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>Pay as you go</literal> (PAYG) images are used to create
      on-demand instances. When an instance is first booted, it automatically
      registers with a local update server. Once the system finishes booting,
      it is ready to use.
     </para>
     <para>
      Create an instance when you need it and delete it when you are
      done. While in use, you have access to updates from &suse; through the
      automatically configured repositories. You only pay for the resources
      you use. Upcharges over the basic cloud prices may apply, depending on
      the image and framework.
     </para>
     <para>
      PAYG instances include support through the cloud service provider. For some PAYG versions, you
      can also purchase &suse; Priority Support. For details, refer to
      <xref linkend="sec-intro-support"/>.
    </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>
   In summary, if you already have a direct relationship with &suse; you
   generally want to start out with BYOS. You can still use PAYG for on-demand
   excess capacity.

   <title>Switching plans</title>
   <para>
    Switching from BYOS to PAYG or vice-versa is only possible on &azure;
    through the <literal>Hybrid Benefit</literal> program. For all other cloud
    providers, you remain on the plan you initially selected for as long as the
    instance is running. The only way to switch plans is to start with the
    other image and rebuild your system.
   </para>
   <!-- FIXME cwickert 2022-02-03: Add link to chapter that describes how to
   change a SUSE instance (once written). -->

   <title>Do not register PAYG instances with the &scc;</title>
   <para>
    Registering PAYG instances with the &scc; or your own &rmt; server will
    create conflicts that are not easily solved. Only register BYOS instances.
    PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update
    server.

  <title>Support</title>
  <para>
   Regardless of the public cloud you use and the plan you choose, &suse; has
   you covered with support. Support is dependent on whether you &quot;bring
   your own subscription&quot; (BYOS) or you use &sle; &quot;on-demand&quot;
   (PAYG). For more information about BYOS and PAYG, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-intro-plans"/>.

      You can transact priority support through the &aws; and &azure; marketplaces, where you

      <para>
       &suse; is committed to making priority support available in more countries. In the meantime,
       you can still use &suse; PAYG products with regular support from the CSP. If you want support
