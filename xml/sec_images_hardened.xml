 <title>Hardened Images</title>
 <para>
  To improve overall security, &suse; provides hardened images of some products.
  The images are hardened using <phrase role="product">&openscap;</phrase>, a
  collection of open source tools that implement the <systemitem
  class="protocol">Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)</systemitem>
  maintained by the <orgname>National Institute of Standards and Technology
  (NIST)</orgname>. <phrase role="product">&openscap;</phrase> supports
  automated configuration, vulnerability and patch checking, technical control
  compliance activities, and security measurement.
 </para>
 <para>
  All images are pre-hardened to the extent they can safely be hardened without
  causing problems in public cloud frameworks. Certain rules can only be
  applied after instance creation, for example:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Rules that require having passwords set up. Passwords would have to be
    public if configured during image build. This would defeat the purpose of
    a secret password.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Rules that affect the network configuration. Networking is set up during
    instance creation, therefore it is not possible to limit access during
    image build.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Rules for custom partitioning. &suse;'s public cloud images are partitioned
    to meet the requirements of the framework in which they are released.
    If your system needs to adhere to standards that require separate file
    systems for given directories, we recommend that you build your own images
    and use LVM or move those directories onto attached disks to get the
    strictest data separation possible.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Rules to remove packages. &suse;'s public cloud images cater a wide range of
    use cases. Even if the number of packages is limited, it is impossible to
    determine what packages an instance requires.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  After instance creation, users
  can use the installed <package>openscap</package> packages to complete the
  image hardening process using any of the following profiles:
